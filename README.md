# TSP_GA
Genetic Algorithm for TSP written in python

The GA code is copied from https://gist.github.com/turbofart/3428880 which is based on Java code by Lee Jacobson found in an article
entitled "Applying a genetic algorithm to the travelling salesman problem"
that can be found at: http://goo.gl/cJEY1


The ACO code is based on the Solving the Travelling Salesman Problem Using the Ant Colony Optimization paper at http://www.ef.uns.ac.rs/mis/archive-pdf/2011%20-%20No4/MIS2011_4_2.pdf. That paper uses code from http://www.mathworks.com/matlabcentral/fileexchange/15049-solving-tsp-with-ant-colony-system
